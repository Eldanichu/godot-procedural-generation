# Space game procedural content generation workflow and case study.

In this section, we explore the idea of two types of PCG-driven space games: a more arcade style version with an inifte world of asteroids and planets to explore infinite world generation, and a more simulationist space game with empires, galactic systems, and historical lore. We also look at generating a procedural weapon and equipment system, tacking modules together to easily change behaviors.

Outline:

1. Infinite world generation
  - White noise generation
  - Blue noise improvements
  - Layers of generational details
  - Saving and loading modifications
1. Ship/weapons systems generation
  - Stats generation
  - Name generation
  - VFX generation
  - Icon generation
1. Finite world and world lore building
  - Building a galaxy world
  - Plotting galactic empires
  - Simulating historical changes
  - Warp routes generation
